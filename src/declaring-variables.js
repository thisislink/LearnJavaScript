let creditCard = 'Visa'; // this assigns the value Visa to a variable called creditCard
let cardBalance = '10.00'; //this assigns the value of 10.00 to a variable called cardBalance
const creditCardLimit = '1000.00'; //this assigns the value 1000.00 to a variable called creditCardLimit and it cannot be changed because of the const variable declaration

/*
You can create aka declare variable names as anything you want.

For example, if you wanted to create a variable to hold kitchen items you can do something like

let kitchenItems = 'fork';

Try to make sure your variable names are descriptive, instead of using x, a, etc.

There are a few other rules to variables you must follow:

They must start with a letter, an underscore, or a dollar sign.
They also must not be a reserved JavaScript keyword, such as let, import, int, string, etc.

You will learn more JavaScript keywords as you progress.

// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
/* Note: it's worth mentioning, you might come across older JavaScript files that use the var keyword to declare variables. 

Best practice is to only use let and const. However, if you see var it is used the same way. 

The issue with var is it can cause issues in regards to scope. You will learn more about scope later on.
